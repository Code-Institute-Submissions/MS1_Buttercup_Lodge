# Buttercup Lodge - by Michael McCann

## Fictitious website and case studies created for education purposes.

Bed and Breakfast establishment initially called **The Buttercup B 'n' B** approach me with the task of completely updating their website and giving them a brand new logo. Before I started anything, I made the suggestion to the owners if I could change the name as The Buttercup B 'n' B didn't particulary roll off the tongue. They were more than happy with me to go ahead with it and were delighted with the new purposed name of, **Buttercup Lodge**. The word "*lodge*" feels welcoming, cosier and much more inviting than B 'n' B. Luckily, for me they had no business cards printed.

We spoke at length about how I could help them and agreed on the below.

<ol>
    <li>To give them a clean crisp logo.</li>
    <li>To build them an elagant website that will attract new customers and to bring.</li>
    <li>To help them build on their web rankings.</li>
</ol>

The website will have a **Home**, an **Accomodation**, a **Contact** and a **Book Now** section.
