# Buttercup Lodge - Fictitious website built for education purposes

Bed and Breakfast establishment initially called **The Buttercup B 'n' B** approach me with the task of completely updating their website and giving them a brand new logo. Before I started anything, I made the suggestion to the owners if I could change the name as The Buttercup B 'n' B didn't particulary roll off the tongue. They were delighted with the new purposed name of, **Buttercup Lodge**. The word "*lodge*" feels welcoming, cosier and much more inviting than B 'n' B. 

We spoke at length about how I could help them and their brand.
